## How to contribute to coding:

1. The repository administrator creates a feature branch (accessed based on the develop branch), feature-xxx, for the community development team.

2. The community development team forks (feature-xxx) to its own repository after the self-test on development is completed.

3. The community development team submits pr to the official feature-xxx (merge the modification of the official develop branch before submission)

4. Repository administrator merges feature-xxx into one of the proposed branch, e.g. feature-platon-1.1.5

5. Testers verify the functions of the proposed branch feature-platon-1.1.5. Issue the problem if any 

6. After the test is completed, merge it into the develop branch
